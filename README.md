# Pathfinding Visualizer

This is an updated version of an old pathfinding visualizer I wrote in C++ a long-ish time ago. That program no longer works due to some linking mistakes I made with the SFML library. 

This new visualizer is written in Java, so I can keep the language fresh in my memory.

If for some reason you want to actually run this thing, just download or clone the repository, then type ``gradle run`` in the project's root directory.
